                        Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health disorder that affects a person's thoughts, emotions, and behavior, often causing hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive difficulties. While its exact cause is unclear, itâ€™s believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and brain chemistry factors. Counseling, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), plays a vital role in managing schizophrenia. It helps individuals challenge distorted thinking, develop coping strategies, and improve social skills. Combined with medication and a strong support system, therapy can aid in managing symptoms and improving quality of life, enabling individuals to lead more fulfilling lives.
